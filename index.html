            <p> I specialize in delivering data quality control solutions for EDC and LIMS systems, as well as data reconciliation and general quality control workflows.
                Before transitioning to full-time data work, I worked for 4 years in wet laboratory settings, which has provided me with in-depth knowledge of biospecimen collection, processing, and storage procedures.
                This interdisciplinary background has allowed me to design and implement effective, compliant collection designs for clinical trials. 
                My goal is to help define the solutions that work for your clinical research team.</p>
